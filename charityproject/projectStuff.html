                    <h2> Process of Creation </h2>
                    <p> I created this product to resemble that of a website for a charity
                        organization against animal cruelty. I used various other charity
                        websites to model my own after and used the skills in HTML and CSS
                        I gained from the course at the school to create the structure and
                        style of the website. I modeled my style after other charity
                        organizations and modern websites that I believed looked good.
                        I used websites such as geeksforgeeks.org when I was stuck or
                        forgot how to do something such as make a border for a div. This
                        will not be included in my Works Cited as, along with the other
                        websites I used, I did not cite it or any of it's information
                        anywhere on my site and googling is a very common thing for
                        programmers. If googling help during programming was something
                        that had to be cited, everything ever programmed would have a very 
                        long list of geeksforgeeks, stackoverflow, and w3schools links.
