                        People who abuse animals typically do it by intentional abuse or 
                        animal hoarding. Intentional cruelty to animals is typically 
                        correlated with other violent crimes. Animal hoarding is typically 
                        done by people who have more animals than they can take care of. 
                        The most common animals abused are pets like dogs, cats, horses or 
                        livestock. However, our prosecution of these crimes is seriously 
                        lacking at best and non-existent on average. Organized cruelty, 
                        such as dogfighting or cockfighting, often go hand in hand with 
                        other organized crime too, such as drug cartels.

                        Meredith Lee, of the Humane Society of the United States, states that, 
                        "Intentional cruelty to animals is strongly correlated with other 
                        crimes, including violence against people," and Deena Ferguson, of the 
                        magazine <i>Animals</i>, also states that, "there is a strong connection
                        between animal abuse and many antisocial behaviors, which can and often
                        do include violent crimes against people," in their articles 
                        "Animal cruelty facts and stats" and "Chains of violence: a hard look 
                        at violence reveals a link between cruelty to animals and cruelty to 
                        people" respectively.

                        This tells us many things. For one, the American justice system should
                        take animal abuse a lot more seriously than it does. To the American
                        justice system, animal abuse is a joke and criminals get, at most, a
                        slap on the wrist and, on average, nothing. According to these articles
                        and many other articles, studies, and papers, animal abuse is not a joke
                        and should be taken much more seriously in the legal system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even outside of the legal system, animal abuse should be taken very 
                        seriously. Animals, like us, feel emotions. They can feel happiness,
                        excitement, pride, sadness, and pain. When people abuse animals, it
                        is no better than abusing a human. For example, cats and dogs are much
                        weaker than us and were bred to rely on us. When people abuse those 
                        poor animals, it is no better than abusing their own child. Of course,
                        this does not exclude other forms of pets such as horses, livestock,
                        or birds, since they were bred to rely on humans.

                        <p>
                            Animal cruelty is a disease that plagues the modern world. No matter
                            how many technological advancements we as a species make, it does not
                            make us any less of an animal than a dog, cat, or horse. The same 
                            pain that we feel can be felt by all other animals and we have no
                            reason to willingly inflict pain and suffering on other creatures.
                            Yet, we do. Tens of thousands of animals are abused every day. We
                            strive to stop that. We know it is an impossible task, to stop
                            animal cruelty. But it is still a task that must be done. We have
                            people on the frontlines in courts, protests, rallies, adoption
                            centers, etc. fighting on the frontlines to eliminate or, at the very
                            least, minimize/lower the animal cruelty in our world.

                    <h2> How you can help</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p> The best way you can help is by donating to an organization like us,
                            that takes all the money they get from donations and puts it to
                            helping animals in tough situations. Another way you can help for free 
                            is through your legal system by voting, protesting, or lobbying for 
                            judicial change in the treatment of animal abuse. When you donate
                            to us, you get a bag of gifts, completely free, from us as a 
                            thank-you for your donation. 50% of our donations received will be donated
                            directly to animal shelters in need and the other 50% will be distributed
                            amongst our many projects on the frontlines against animal abuse. We
                            really appreciate every donation and we need all the help and money we
                            can get.

                    <div>
                        <p> A large amount of people think "Oh, my vote doesn't matter," or
                            "My $5 won't do any good." But this is simply not true. So many people
                            think that and it leads to unfavorable situations, such as a bad politician
                            winning the vote or a charity not getting as much money as it needs.
                            Your vote DOES matter. Your $5 DO matter. Whatever you can do that can help
                            WILL help. So if you're thinking about donating or supporting the cause
                            through other means such as protesting, do it. It <b>will</b> matter.
